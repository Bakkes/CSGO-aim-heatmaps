CSGO-aim-heatmaps
=================

The SourceMod plugin AimHeatmapData.sp calculates and saves data which can be used to generate a heatmap of the players aim accuracy. Example: http://i.imgur.com/uzZPBoZ.png

The Mathematica script is not relevant anymore since everything apart from the plotting code has been reimplemented in the server plugin.
